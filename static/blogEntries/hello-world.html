<p>
    Hello, and welcome to my blog. Online, I'm known as <em><strong>aphids</strong></em> or <em><strong>aphidian</strong></em>. I am a recent CS grad, programmer and system administrator. I'm a Linux enthusiast; I've been daily-driving Arch Linux since 2021 and I usually like to image Debian for my home server and VPSes. Music has been a growing influence in my life since my later adolescence, I'm most fond with metal music (primarily black metal, though I'm well acquainted with various other metal subgenres), post-punk, alt. rock and ambient music. I also love lifting weights & calisthenics, hiking and gardening. I programmed and self-hosted this blog to serve as an outlet for my aforementioned topics and interests, but I might also discuss current events or write guides if I think I have something worth sharing.
</p>

    If you're generally well read, you might be able to tell that I haven't written much long-form prose since graduating university; my writing is not as well-expressed nor as articulate as I'd like it to be. I hope that my writing does improve as I add more blog entries to this site, and I hope that my writing isn't too clumsy that it detracts you from reading them. Regardless, I appreciate if these entries get read at all, and I'm more than happy to receive comments or questions about them if you contact me <a href="/about">here</a>.

<h4 id="technical-overview"><a href="#technical-overview">technical overview of the blog</a></h4>
<p>
    This blog is running on a mini-framework that I wrote using SvelteKit. It's not extremely advanced, it just provides a way to easily implement code reuse for various elements of a blog (tagging system, styling, indexing entries, etc). One could easily accomplish most of this site's functionality through a (SSG static-site generator) like <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Personally, there are a few reasons why I opted to write my blog without one.
</p>
<ol>
        <li>I wanted the flexibility to potentially implement dynamic components in the future</li>
        <li>This was an excuse to learn a frontend technology</li>
</ol>
<p>
    If I'm remembering correctly, some SSGs allow users to program JS components, or you could use a frontend technology on top of an SSG, but I feel like that's more convoluted than necessary. A CMS could fill my requirement for the first point, but I feel like that's overkill for a site that's relatively minimal like mine. That being said, using a SSG or CMS would probably be the recommended option for starting your own blog, but my experience programming this site was enjoyable. This blog is currently source-avaliable on <a href="https://github.com/aphidianxyz/aphidian.xyz">Github</a> (feel free to create an issue/PR to call me stupid), and I'll put a permissive license on it in the near future.
