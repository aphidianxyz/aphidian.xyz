    Welcome to my blog, online I'm known as <em><strong>aphids</strong></em> or <em><strong>aphidian</strong></em>. I'm a programmer/system administrator. I made this blog so that I could have my very own self-hosted outlet to post about various topics that interest me and to document my endeavors in programming/homelabbing. I've been daily driving Arch Linux since 2021, I might write about my experiences with Linux in another blog entry, but the experience has generally been positive for me. Music has been a growing aspect of my life starting in my later adolescence; I love metal music (mostly black metal, but I'm quite familiar with other metal subgenres also), post-punk, alt-rock and ambient music. I love lifting weights, hiking and gardening as well.

    As you might be able to tell, I haven't written any long-form prose since I've graduated from university, so my writing is not as well-expressed nor as articulate as I'd like it to be. I hope that these blog entries serves as effective exercises in improving my writing, and I apologize if you find my entries to be clumsly written. I greatly appreciate anyone reading what I have to say, though, and I'm more than happy to answer any questions about any of my posts if you <a href="/about">contact me</a>.

    I wrote a mini-framework for writing these blog entries using SvelteKit. Utilizing a static-site generator like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> would be less effort, but I wanted to have the flexibility to add JS components on my site while learning a frontend framework. That being said, I would recommend the previously mentioned static-site generators if you wanted to have a quick and easy blog.

<p>Here is a fibonacci implementation in <code>Go</code>:</p>
<pre>
<code>
func fib(num int) *big.Int {
    switch num {
    case 0: 
        return big.NewInt(0)
    case 1:
        return big.NewInt(1)
    default:
        sum := big.NewInt(0)
        sum.Add(sum, fibNoDyn(num - 1))
        sum.Add(sum, fibNoDyn(num - 2))
        return sum
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
